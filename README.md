# Memory

This is a simple game just for practice my JS skills. 

[Play it here.](on ghpages http://nosdmitry.github.io/memory)

## What to do?

You will find several cards, the goal is to flip each card. When you click one card it would flip. If you flip another one and it is not the same - both of them flip back, otherwise they would stay flipped till the end of the game. When each card will be flipped the game ends and you'll see click statistic message.

## Plans for future

1. Make opportunity to choose backface picture of cards on display.
2. Choose number of cards to play with.
3. Use ReactJS.

## How to install

Just download and run index.html
